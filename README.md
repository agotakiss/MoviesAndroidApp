# BlackSwan Android Test app

Show us what you can do and how clean your code is!

Write an app that loads the most popular movies from theMovieDb.com and displays them. You can use the given basic app skeleton, but please rename the package from com.greenfox.androidtest to com.*yourname*.androidtest. You are allowed to modify the existing code, it is for your help. 

**The Moviedb.org is an online database that lets you: browse and rate movies, TV shows and people.
